	<h2>My experience</h2>
		
		<p>I've been going to Bay View every year during the Summer for as long as I can remember. With very old houses and some of my best friends, this has become one of my favorite places in the world. Once you hit a certain age you are able to attend the club, where you hangout with many other kids your age and play games and activities. Also me and my family have a tradiditon of going on a pontune trip on the final day and spending the day on the boat and water. One of my favorite memories comes from when me, my brother(Eric), and Sophie(my best friend there) decided to build a really small fort on the hill side outside of the house my grandparents own. It still stands today.Another year me, my brother and Sophie went to someones house around 10pm and played Cards against humanity for a while.<br>
Besides having great memories of this place there are many other reasons to go. The scenery is fantastic, along with the people that live there. If you were to go you would have a blast and would want to return.
